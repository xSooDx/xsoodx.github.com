Greetings! I'm Saurabh Sood, a gamer, software engineer, game developer and designer from India. I am currently pursuing a [Masters of Entertainment, Arts & Engineering](https://games.utah.edu/prospective-students/master-of-entertainment-arts-and-engineering/) (MEAE) degree, in the Engineering Track, at the University of Utah. I am also a graduate research assistant at the [GApp Lab](https://games.utah.edu/research/about-the-gapp/). 

I have graduated with a Bachelor's in Technology from PES University and worked at [Moonfrog Labs](https://moonfroglabs.com/), a leading mobile game studio in India, for over 2 years. Prior to that I worked at [Ittiam Systems](https://www.ittiam.com/) as a Software Engineer working on video encoding technology.

I've been gaming ever since I can remember, due to which I've developed a strong passion for science, technology, and art. I love participating in game jams and exploring various aspects of games such as design, gameplay, AI, physics, procedural generation, graphics, and shader programming. Over the past decade, I've created various projects exploring mobile apps, web apps, operating systems, design patterns, recommendation engines, machine learning and, of course, games. I also have an interest in art, with knowledge of graphic design and 3D modelling. Recently I have started exploring the fascinating world of CAD and 3D printing.

In 2017, I founded the [PES Game Dev Club](https://pes-gdc.github.io/) at PES University and hosted its first 24 hour game jam, the GG JAM 2018. I have also [conduct workshops](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pesuniversity_workshop-on-game-development-held-the-students-activity-6636975433931943936-r4hS) and been invited to judge events on game development.

Here you will find a collection of some of my work, projects and hobbies.
