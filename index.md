Greetings! I'm Saurabh Sood, Software Engineer and Game Designer from India. I am currently pursuing a [Masters of Entertainment, Arts & Engineering](https://games.utah.edu/prospective-students/master-of-entertainment-arts-and-engineering/) (MEAE) degree, in the Engineering Track, at the University of Utah. I am also a graduate research assistant at the [GApp Lab](https://games.utah.edu/research/about-the-gapp/).

My passion lies in building systems and tools for games - focusing on Gameplay, AI, Simulations, Procedural Generation, Optimization and Asset Integration. Over the past decade, I've created over 30 projects covering video games, mobile and web apps, operating systems, design patterns, recommendation engines, AI and machine learning. I also have a deep interest in digital art, with knowledge of graphic design, 3D modelling and 3D printing.
