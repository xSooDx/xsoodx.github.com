Carioca is a Rummy style card game originating from Chile. Moonfrog's **Carioca Club** is the first and only carioca game on play store. It requires luck, skills and tricks to win. 

The game was developed using the Cocos2D-x C++ frame work for Android play store, with the backend written in Javascript/Typescript and using Couchbase and MongoDB databases.

### My Responsibilities
- Front end UI/UX development in C++ & Cocos2D-x
- Backend development using Javascript & Typescript
- Improvements to matchmaking and room joining logic to reduce wait times
- Integration of interstitial ads to the game
- Friends and social features
