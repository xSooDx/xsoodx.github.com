title: "'Contain' Mechanic Gymnasium"
---

For the 2nd Rapid Prototype Project at the MEAE program, we were tasked with building a Gymnasium to test out mechanics based on a given verb in Unreal Engine 5. The goal was to have every member of the team use Blueprints to create their own mechanics that we would combine together. 

Our verb was '**Contain**'. We created a bunch of mechanics based on containing and capturing creatures. You can shoot creatures with matching colors to stun them, contain them in traps and return them to storage pads. Use colored lasers to stun creatures further away. The lasers can reflect of certain surfaces and open doors too.
