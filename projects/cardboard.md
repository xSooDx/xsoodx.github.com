title: "Cardboard Chronicles (Work in progress)"
---

This is my current thesis project for my Master's in Entertainment Arts & Engineering at the University of Utah. We are building a puzzle-action-adventure game with a unique art style of everything being built out of cardboard.

Leading a team of 13, my roles are the game's director, engineer and technical designer.

We came up with an initial prototype in 2 weeks that got us greenlit for the next phase of full development (currently in progress). Our prototype had a few simple mechanics. The player could slam in 4 directions to attack enemies, or could slide under enemies to fling them. During the prototype we established our unique cardboard art style,as well as the core pillars of our game:
- Keep it Simple
- Keep it playful
- Keep it Cardboard
