title: "Asteroid Belt"
---

Play as a spacecraft flying through a deadly asteroid belt. Avoid getting hit by the oncoming asteroids and survive for as long as you can in this relaxing yet intense infinite space runner.

**Asteroid Belt** was a game I made in 2015 as a side project during my second year at PES University. It was the first app I published on the Android Play Store. It was built using the *libGDX* Java game development framework, back when Eclipse for Android development was still a thing.

Asteroids are randomly spawned off-screen and flung towards the ship. They occasionally collide with one another causing chaotic moments in gameplay. The spaceship is controlled using pure acceleration that is adjusted via touch drags.

While it is no longer available on the Play Store, you can still download the game from the itch.io link below.
