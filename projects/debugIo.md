Made for the [Blackthornprod Game Jam #1](https://itch.io/jam/blackthornprod-game-jam-1/rate/319164) in the meta theme of "Game Development".

Overwhelm yourself with bugs, errors and warnings, while navigating through a *mindfield* of ideas! Don't bite off more than you can chew.

Every idea has its challenges.
