title: "Mad Mechs"
---

Made for the GMTK Game Jam 2020, Mad Mechs is a twin-stick top down action shooter in the theme of "Out of Control" and inspired by games like [Alien Shooter](https://store.steampowered.com/app/33100/Alien_Shooter/) and [Alien Swarm](https://store.steampowered.com/app/630/Alien_Swarm/).

A rouge AI has taken control of all the factories and is creating an endless stream of killer mechs. Take control of a poorly hacked mech, with heavy weapons but malfunctions sporadically, and destroy all the factories before they overwhelm you.
