The game achieves it's dark atmosphere by simply using silhouettes on top of a black background and then using white sprites in between give a flash light effect.

There are 3 types of monster roaming the forest.
- The ghosts that are alerted by light and will chase you if spooked.
- The chargers that are also alerted by light, but charge at you at high speed.
- The Stalker that hides in the trees and will jump out to catch you. You need to shine your light on it to make it flea.
