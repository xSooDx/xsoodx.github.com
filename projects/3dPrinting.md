title: "3D Printing"
---

In early 2021, a couple of friends an I pooled in to buy an Ender 3 3D printer, and it was hands down one of the best decisions we made. Being able to manufacture toys, tickets and tools at home is an amazing power. 3D printing has become one of my favourite hobbies and has keep me distracted and busy during the pandemic. It is also an excellent way to make personalized gifts for friends and family.

This hobby has also introduced me to CAD modelling. In mid 2021, I bought my own Ender 3 Pro, and have used it to [restore an old damaged laptop of mine to working conditions](/projects/aioPC). I plan to use this for many more projects in the future.
