title: "BlogOn: Blogging Engine"
---

BlogOn is a complete blogging engine I worked on with a friend for our Web Technologies course in 2017.

The engine featured a full content management system, with a creator dashboard, pages, posts and comments section, and an in-built rich text editor. The engine was built using a Python Flask server and a MySQL Database to store content.

We developed an API that could be used in Flask's templating code to fetch content from the database.
