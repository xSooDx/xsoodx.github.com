title: "Converting Broken Laptop to All-In-One PC"
---

My first major project with 3d printing was an attempt to restore an old broken laptop of mine into working condition. While the internals still worked, the laptop's hinge had broken and the keyboard was essentially unusable. The goal was to salvage what was still usable and convert it into an all-in-one desktop PC.

After disassembling the laptop, I meticulously measured the distances between the screw holes of the motherboard and LCD screen. With the measurements, I designed a mounting plate for it using FreeCAD. Being too big for my Ender 3 Pro, I had to split the plate into 4 parts and fix them together using screws and printed braces. After several weeks of trial and error, and multiple test prints I had my final design and reused the bottom cover of the laptop as the back cover for the PC. Using a printed tablet holder as a standard, I finally completed the project. 

Although the final result is crude and a number of components are exposed, the PC works like a charm and has a new lease on life. The project taught me a lot about precision manufacturing and CAD principles.
