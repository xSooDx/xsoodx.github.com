title: "Marshmallow Mash"

Marshmallow Mash is a chaotic 4 player couch competitive party game with Twitch Integration for even more mayhem! Capture more wild Marshmallows that your friends. Shoot chocolate at them using various weapons to stun them.

Built in Unreal 5 for the 4th Rapid Prototype the MEAE program at University of Utah. With the requirement of having Twitch chat interactions and be inspired by an earlier prototype.

My focus was on building the AI and Gameplay systems for the game as well as integrating VFX and Art assets given by our artists.

I took this as an opportunity to explore Unreal's Behavior Tree AI System, resulting in an over-engineered AI for the Marshmallows' relatively simple behaviors.

During the polishing phase, I created a simple shader that made the trees and grass sway in the wind, to add more life to the scene.
