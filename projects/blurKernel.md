title: "Blur Kernel Estimation & Deconvolution Method Analysis"
---

This was a project I worked on for my Digital Image Processing course on how to deblur images by estimating a blur kernal and performing deconvolution. We also compare three multiple different deconvolution algorithms - Blind deconvolution, Wiener deconvolution and RichardsonLucy deconvolution, to see which would be the best to use. The project was coded in MatLab.
