title: "Toy Planet"
---

For my first Rapid Prototype project at the MEAE program, we were required to create a 2D game that was inspired by a classic arcade game from before th 1970s. We were to choose a game and modernize it using the Unity Engine. My team chose "Lunar Lander" as our classic arcade game.

We decided to combine Lunar Lander with the mechanics of a claw machine. We converted a skill based moon landing game into one where you need carefully to pick up and drop off toys from the surface of a constantly shifting planet while avoiding Rock Candy meteors.

I created a fully procedural planet surface generator that could morph into new shapes in real time. The generator was fully customizable via the Unity Editor, with parameters for resolution, Simplex noise layers and smoothening.
