A Day of Sofia is a VR narrative serious game designed to teach clinicians and health care professionals about the social determinants of health and cultural humility. Go through the American health care system from the perspective of a Hispanic woman and experience the challenges and struggles she goes through due to her differences in culture, social status and language barrier.

I worked as a Unity engineer for 4 months on the project, collaborating with professors from the College of Nursing. My responsibilities were to build UIs and visual effects for a VR experience.

- Menu, dialogue and navigation UI in VR.
- Systems to track and manage the protagonist health, stress and hunger levels.
- UI elements that are attached to the player's virtual arms to indicate the the above stats.
- VR compatible full screen shader effects that show changes in protagonist's emotions and health.
