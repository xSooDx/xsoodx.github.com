title: "Doom Book (VR)"
--- 

Doom Book is a social commentary VR experience on the psychological effect of [Doomscrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling) and the consumption of excess social media. The game was built in the Unity Engine for the 3rd Rapid Prototype at the MEAE program at University of Utah. The requirement of the project was to a VR serious game using art style of [Pop Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_art).

Watch as your colorful and vibrant Pop Art style bedroom turns into a dull and dreadful mess, as your life gets consumed by the endless stream of negative social media.  

We used [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) to create AI generated images for the social media posts, which also fits into the "Pop Art" association with the artists' use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques.
