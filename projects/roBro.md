In a team of 4, RoBro was our submission for the 48 hour [Global Game Jam 2020](https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/robro-0) in the theme of "REPAIR". You play as RoBro, an old dismantled robot stashed away in a secret lab. You must solve puzzles and reassemble your self piece by piece and find a way out of the lab. Each part of yourself you recover will enable a new functionality.

Built using the Unity Game Engine, the game takes inspiration from the Portal games and features 2 levels. I worked on creating RoBro's body assembly system and control system. I also helped design the puzzles for each level.
