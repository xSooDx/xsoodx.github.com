title: "Box Hunter"
---

Made for the 48 hour [Ludam Dare #44 Compo](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/box-hunter) in the theme of "Your life is currency", Box Hunter is a fast and simple shooter, where your ammunition is your health, and your score is the health you collect beyond maximum. 

Survive for as long as you can against wave after wave of cute yet deadly Boxes. Kill the boxes to drop health orbs and fill up your health, ammo and points. The Boxes come in 2 flavours, small red ones are fast and come in groups. The big yellow ones are slower but can take much more damage.
