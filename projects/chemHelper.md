In 2013, a couple of friends and I teamed up to create a company with the goal of creating educational apps to help students prepare for exam. Our first (and only) app was to help students study chemical equations using flash cards.

My role as the CTO was to the build the app for Android phones, which were still relatively new at the time. Using the Android SDK and the eclipse editor (yes that long ago), I created the app in about a month. With the help of the others, we manually extracted chemical equations from our textbooks and stored them using XML and SQLite onto the app. It also featured a periodic table.

The app received over 10,000 downloads before it was taken down from the Play Store several years later due to it's outdated compatibility.

Sadly as we graduated from school, our paths separated and the company died with it.

The APK is still available on 3rd party archiving sites like [APKPure.com](https://apkpure.com/ncert-chemistry-helper/com.Whydea.chemistryhelper), but it won't work on modern devices.
