title: "Ricochet"
---

My 12th-grade computer science project and one of my earliest game prototypes, Ricochet was a physics puzzle game I made in 2012 using C++, SDL Graphics and Box2D Physics.

The objective is to launch a ball into a target. As the ball travels, it draws an impassable wall along its path. The ball can ricochet off walls 4 times before it is destroyed. To win, you must use these walls to create a path through the level to reach the target.

Unfortunately, due to a hard drive failure, the only remnant I have left of the project is a singe screenshot and this diagram I made using Lucid Chart, showing the file and class relationships.

In this screenshot, the white & blue circle is the starting position and the red circle is the target. The cyan ball leaves a solid line that can be used to bounce towards the target.
